//add singularity to $PATH:
module load singularity

//make some convenience commands to reduce typing (note we changed container name so we can accommodate other cloud providers):
alias gcloud="singularity exec /projects/researchit/crf/containers/gcp_sdk.sif gcloud"
alias gsutil="singularity exec /projects/researchit/crf/containers/gcp_sdk.sif gsutil"

//login to gcloud; this will return a url that you need to paste into a browser, which
//will take you through the google authentication process; you can use your jax
//email as userid and jax password to get in. Once you authenticate, it will display
//a code that you need to paste into the prompt provided in your ssh session on Sumner:

gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser

//see which projects you have access to:
gcloud projects list

//what is the project you are currently associated with:
gcloud config list project

//change project association:
gcloud config set project my-project

//see what buckets are associated with my-project:
gsutil ls

//see contents of a particular bucket:
gsutil ls -l gs://my-bucket

//recursively copy large directory from filesystem accessible on Sumner to your bucket:
gsutil -m -o GSUtil:parallel_composite_upload_threshold=150M cp -r my_dir gs://my_bucket/my_dir

//recursively copy a directory from your bucket to an existing directory on Sumner:
gsutil -m -o GSUtil:parallel_composite_upload_threshold=150M cp -r gs://my_bucket/my_dir my_dir
